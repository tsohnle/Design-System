Edits-to-do:

Disclaimer component: Ensure the text size is at caption rather than regular.
I should've mentioned the spacing around it too. 32px top and bottom; 28px left and right :)

Contact Info: Placed the contact info into a light grey box with 28px margins.

Do you mean 32px top and bottom and 28px left and right? ;)
- No, the font size is not at caption size, so 28px all around ;)

What is this box on the bottom of this page? https://www.alberta.ca/Jobs/pprofile/pp1051744.htm
It doesn't look like a Disclaimer, so it must be something else?
It's a disclaimer.
